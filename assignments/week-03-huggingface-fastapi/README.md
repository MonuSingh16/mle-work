<hr>


### ☑️ Objectives
At the end of this session, you will be able to:
- [ ] Interact with the Hugging Face API
- [ ] Build a simple web app using Fast API
- [ ] Create an API endpoint for your selected pre-trained model

### 📚 Get Started

1. We are reusing our `conda env` from last week's assignment - so you shouldn't have to recreate/download `torch` or `transformers` again!
2. Head on over to the `hugging_face_tutorial` notebook to get started!
