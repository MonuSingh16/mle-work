# <h1 align="center" id="heading">EDA with Walmart Sales</h1>

## Business Objective

Walmart, the retail giant that operates a chain of hypermarkets, wants to understand their weekly sales data, especially the impact from holidays and big events; specifically, Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. In addition, Walmart wants to consider the effect from different macroeconomic and external factors on the weekly sales.

##  ☑️ Learning Objectives

At the end of this session, you will know how to

1. Manipulate data of different types using `pandas`
2. Visualize data with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to extract insights 
3. Build a pipeline to preprocess data and fit a simple model using `sklearn` library

*Note: if you see code that's unfamiliar to you, look up for the documentation, and try to understand what it does.*

## :hammer_and_wrench: Pre-Work

1. activate your `conda` environment; replace `py39_12` with the name of your `conda` environment (`conda env list` to see all available environments)
    ```
    conda activate py39_12
    ```
2. install the required packages under the current directory: `{Your Local Directory}/MLE-11/assignments/eda-walmart-sales/`
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. In VSCode, run notebook [imports](nb/imports.ipynb) and make sure no error messages are displayed when importing the packages.
