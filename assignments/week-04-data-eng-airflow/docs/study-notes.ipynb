    "The initial step in any data science workflow is to acquire and prepare the data to be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Ingestion - Spark, HDFS, CSV, etc. Includes synthetic data generation or data enrichment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploration and Validation - Data profiling - content and structure of the data. Output - metadata (max, min, avg of values).Data validation operations are user-defined error detection functions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Wrangling (Cleaning) - Re-formatting particular attributes and correcting errors in data, such as missing values imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Labeling - The operation of the Data Engineering pipeline, where each data point is assigned to a specific category.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Splitting - Splitting the data into training, validation, and test datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and executing machine learning algorithms to obtain an ML model.\n",

    "1. Model Training - The process of applying the machine learning algorithm on training data to train an ML model. Feature engineering and the hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Evaluation - Validating the trained model to ensure it meets original codified objectives before serving the ML model\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Testing - Performing the final “Model Acceptance Test” by using the hold backtest dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Packaging - Exporting the final ML model into a specific format (e.g. PMML, PFA, or ONNX),\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration of the previously engineered ML model into existing software. This stage includes the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Serving - The process of addressing the ML model artifact in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Performance Monitoring - Performance on live and previously unseen data, such as prediction or recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Performance Logging - Every inference request results in the log-record.\n",
