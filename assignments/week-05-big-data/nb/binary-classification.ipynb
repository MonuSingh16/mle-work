variables in the dataset into numeric variables.\nThere are two ways to do this.\n\n* Category Indexing\n\n  This is basically assigning a numeric value to each category from {0, 1, 2, ...numCategories-1}.\n  This introduces an implicit ordering among your categories, and is more suitable for ordinal variables (eg: Poor: 0, Average: 1, Good: 2)\n\n* One-Hot Encoding\n\n  This converts categories into binary vectors with at most one nonzero value (eg: (Blue: [1, 0]), (Green: [0, 1]), (Red: [0, 0]))\n\nThis notebook uses a combination of [StringIndexer] and, depending on your Spark version, either [OneHotEncoder] or [OneHotEncoderEstimator] to convert the categorical variables.\n`OneHotEncoder` and `OneHotEncoderEstimator` return a [SparseVector]. \n\nSince there is more than one stage of feature transformations, use a [Pipeline] to tie the stages together.\nThis simplifies the code.\n\n[StringIndexer]:
