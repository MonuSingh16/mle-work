    "Amazon SageMaker Autopilot is an automated machine learning (commonly referred to as AutoML) solution for tabular datasets. You can use SageMaker Autopilot in different ways: on autopilot (without any human input) or with human guidance, without code through SageMaker Studio or scripted using the AWS SDKs. This notebook will use the AWS SDKs to simply create and deploy a machine learning model without doing any feature engineering manually. We will also explore the auto-generated feature importance report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting housing prices is a classic linear regression problem in ML. The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district (as a group) and include summary stats about them based on census data from 1990. The dataset variables are easily understandable, and the columns are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```longitude```\n",
    "* ```latitude```\n",
    "* ```housingMedianAge```\n",
    "* ```totalRooms```\n",
    "* ```totalBedrooms```\n",
    "* ```population```\n",
    "* ```households```\n",
    "* ```medianIncome```\n",
    "* ```medianHouseValue``` (target)\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're going to try to predict is the median house value for a district. We will let Autopilot perform feature engineering, model selection, model tuning, and give us the best candidate model ready to use for inferences.\n",
